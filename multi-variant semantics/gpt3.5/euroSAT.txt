                'This class represents areas where crops are planted and harvested annually. In satellite images, it is typically identified by areas of regularly tilled soil and a consistent pattern of crop rotation. The land often appears as patches of green in the growing season, followed by bare soil or different crop types in subsequent seasons.',
                'Forests are characterized by dense tree coverage, often appearing as large, continuous patches of green in satellite imagery. The canopy cover can vary in density, with variations in color depending on the season and the type of trees present. Forests play a crucial role in carbon storage and biodiversity.',
                'This category includes areas covered by non-woody plants like grasses, herbs, and small shrubs. In satellite imagery, these regions often show lighter green or yellowish tones, especially during the growing season. Herbaceous vegetation is typically found in open fields, meadows, and grasslands.',
