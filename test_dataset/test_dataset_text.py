    "This is a Coronal Cross-section of the Tibia and Fibula: It shows both bones running parallel in the lower leg. The tibia, larger and weight-bearing, is paired with the fibula, which offers stability. Muscles, tendons, and vessels are depicted, crucial for leg movement and balance.",
    "This is a Sagittal Cross-section of the Lumbosacral Spine: It highlights the vertebrae, discs, and spinal cord of the lower back. The curve of the lumbosacral region, essential for load-bearing and movement, is visible, providing insight into the support structure of the spinal column.",
    "This is a Horizontal Cross-section of the Bladder: It shows the bladder's rounded structure in the pelvic cavity, with thick muscular walls. The position relative to other pelvic organs, including the ureters and urethra, is visible, emphasizing its role in urine storage and excretion.",
    "This is a Sagittal Cross-section of the Cervical-Thoracic Spine: It displays the transition from cervical to thoracic vertebrae. The vertebral bodies, intervertebral discs, and spinal cord are shown, providing an understanding of neck and upper back anatomy and the spinal cord's protective pathway."
